# train_scheduler

This application allows you to enter information for ficticious trains.  Information that is added pertains to the train's
schedule, including the start time of the initial train, the train's frequency at one stop, and destination information.

Some information for the existing trains can be modified, or the existing train can be removed altogether.  Furthermore,
some information for existing trains is stored in a server such that the data persists (Google Firebase).
